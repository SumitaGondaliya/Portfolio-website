# Portfolio-website
Portfolio

This is the Portfolio website of myself which I created using HTML,CSS and JavaScript
I tried Typed.js for some creativity in to my portfolio.
The things I learned is how to use CSS in the HTML page it self and dynamic design of the page in the single 
HTML page which I found the most important task for me.
